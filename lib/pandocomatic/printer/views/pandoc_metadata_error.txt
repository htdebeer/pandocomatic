Expected to extract YAML metadata blocks from file '<%= @error.data %>', but did not succeed. Make sure '<%= @error.data %>' is a pandoc markdown file. Check YAML syntax of all metadata blocks; make sure that all horizontal lines have at least four (4) dashes.

<% if @error.error? %>Reported cause(s):
  <%= @error.error.to_s %><% end %>
